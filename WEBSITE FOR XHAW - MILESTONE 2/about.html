        Precious Radebe, the person who is responsible for Empowering The Nation wants to provide skills training for domestic
        workers and gardeners. Her parents and other elderly relatives were never given the
        chance to upskill themselves or follow a formal educational qualification so this training
        school is her way of supporting similarly affected members from her community
        <br>
